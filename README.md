# 📖 My Book App
This is a small web application that lets you create your own virtual book library, search for books using the OpenLibrary API, and add them to your personal collection.
The project serves as a practice for working with JavaScript, APIs, ES6 modules, DOM manipulation, and class-based architecture.
A shop system for virtually "buying" books is already planned.

## 📚 Data Source
This project uses the OpenLibrary API to fetch book information based on titles or ISBNs.
The book data (such as title, author, and cover images) comes directly from OpenLibrary – a non-profit project by the Internet Archive Foundation with the goal of creating an open library for everyone.
